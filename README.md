Contributions are encouraged, but I expect a high standard of quality. I promise to give a thoughtful review and guide you towards success, even if you're new to coding.

Since your time is valuable, keep these points in mind:

1. Commit the minimum diffs to make your change
2. New UI should be _Material Plus_ (Material with a little extra sparkle âœ¨)
3. New UX should be simple and thoughtful
4. New code should follow existing patterns
